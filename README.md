# Sign Language Detection using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow
Project Image

Description
Welcome to my personal project, Sign Language Detection! This project aims to provide a solution for real-time sign language recognition using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By leveraging the power of MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, this project enables the detection and interpretation of sign language gestures, ultimately bridging the communication gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities.

Features
Real-time sign language detection using a combination of MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
Utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for robust gesture recognition.
Supports a wide range of sign language alphabets or custom gestures based on the training dataset.
Offers flexibility for customization and extension to incorporate additional gestures or functionality.

How it Works
Capturing Input: The project utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to capture video input from a webcam or any compatible camera device.
Preprocessing: The captured video frames are preprocessed to extract relevant features and landmarks.
Gesture Recognition: The tracked landmarks are fed into the LSTM neural network trained on sign language datasets to recognize the corresponding gestures.
Output Visualization: The recognized gestures are displayed on the terminal
